# Linux Server Configuration Project

## I.P Address and port to acsess server via SSH
grader@52.65.31.177 -p 2200

## URL to hosted web application
`http://ec2-52-65-31-177.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/`

# Steps taken to complete this project/reference

## Update the available package list
`sudo apt-get update`

## Upgrade those packages from the previous list
`sudo apt-get upgrade`

1. Download the default key of the instance and use it to login to the system
2. Before I could log on to the instance, I needed to change the permissions of the default private key
that I had saved on my local machine.
(See post: https://discussions.udacity.com/t/warning-unprotected-private-key-file/369966) `sudo chmod 600 /Users/maxcarey/.ssh/LightsailDefaultPrivateKey-ap-southeast-2.pem`

## Log-in on default port 22 using the default key
`ssh ubuntu@52.65.31.177 -p 22 -i /Users/maxcarey/.ssh/LightsailDefaultPrivateKey-ap-southeast-2.pem`

## Use ssh key-gen to create a new public private key and upload it to the server. Once done, make sure you can login with:
`ssh ubuntu@52.65.31.177 -p 22 -i /Users/maxcarey/.ssh/linuxProj`

## Add port to 2200 in the sshd_config file (keep both of the ports up and test them before deleting 22). Open the configuration file with:
`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

## On the Lightsail interface allow create a `CUSTOM`rule for allowing port `2200`. (Note: it doesn't say SSH necessarily)

## Since ssh configuration file is modified, we need to run the following command to restart the service:
`sudo service ssh restart`

## Make sure you can log in via both ports
`ssh ubuntu@52.65.31.177 -p 22 -i pathToFile`
`ssh ubuntu@52.65.31.177 -p 2200 -i pathToFile`

## Delete port 22 in configuration file

## Configure uncomplicated firewall
1. Establish default rule for incoming connections `sudo ufw default deny incoming`
2. Establish a default rule for outgoing requests `sudo ufw default allow outgoing`
3. Open port 2200 (Since SSH is going to be on port 2200, which is not the default we must run `sudo ufw allow 2200`. On the contrary, `sudo ufw allow ssh` would automatically open port 22.
4. Open NTP and HTTP ports 
`sudo ufw allow ntp` (port 80)
`sudo ufw allow htp` (123)
5. Enabnle Firewall
`sudo ufw enable`

## Create a new user called grader
`sudo adduser grader`
Give them a password of "grader" and leave all the other settings blank

## Add this new user to the sudo list
`sudo usermod -aG sudo grader`

## Switch into the new user to and list the contents of the root directory to make sure they have the right permissions
`su - grader`
`sudo ls -al /`
(Question: when running `su - ubuntu` to switch back, it looks like I never stored a password for the Ubuntu user)

## On local machine generate a key-pair (always do this on local machine so that private key is ALWAYS private)
`ssh-keygen`
Don't give the key a password

## On the server, in the location /home/grader
`sudo nano .ssh/authorized_keys Paste in the puublic key in one line in the file authorized_keys`

## Change some of the permissions on these newly created keys
`sudo chmod700 .ssh`
`sudo chmod644 authorized_keys`

## Reference for octal permissions
r = 4 (read)
w = 2 (write)
x = 1 (execute)

## Set owner and group of each of these files to grader
`sudo chown grader .ssh`
`sudo chgrp grader .ssh`
`sudo chown grader .ssh/authorized_keys`
`sudo chgrp grader .ssh/authorized_keys`

## Change to Universal Coordinate Time
### Follow the instructions here:

## Install the Apache HTTP Server
`sudo apt-get install apache2`

## Use the I.P address at the top of this file to see if the default apache server index.html `/var/www/html/index.html`

##Install Apache 2 application handler (for Python 3 in my case)
Python 3: `sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3`
Python 2: `sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi`

## Restart Apache
sudo service apache2 restart

## Install postgresql
sudo apt-get install postgresql

# Check that no remote connections are allowed:
* Follow instructions here: https://discussions.udacity.com/t/disallowing-remote-connections-to-my-postgresql-db/36364/2
* Either way we can see by default that the file does not allow any remote connections so no changes are necessary

sudo nano /etc/postgresql/9.5/main/pg_hba.conf


# Switch user to posgres
sudo su - postgres

# Get into psql shell
psql

# Create a catalog database
CREATE DATABASE catalog;

# Add a user called catalog
CREATE USER catalog;

# Give that user a password
ALTER ROLE catalog WITH PASSWORD 'cataloghorsechair';

# Grant all privelages to that user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE catalog TO catalog;





# Configure apache to hand off requests to the applcation handler




#  Further configuration





You then need to configure Apache to handle requests using the WSGI module. Youâ€™ll do this by editing the /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf file. This file tells Apache how to respond to requests, where to find the files for a particular site and much more. You can read up on everything this file can do within the Apache documentation.

For now, add the following line at the end of the <VirtualHost *:80> block, right before the closing </VirtualHost> line: WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/html/myapp.wsgi

Finally, restart Apache with the sudo apache2ctl restart command.

You might get a warning saying "Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name". If you do, don't worry about it. Check out this AskUbuntu thread for a discussion of the cause of this message.

# Installing a PostgreSQL database server
(Didn't I use an sqlite database for the backend project????)
sudo apt-get install postgresql







# Notes from the class are copied below:


# Create a new user
sudo adduser

# The example videos say port 2222, but I'm on a different port at least that is what I have found out thanks to the instructions videos

# Here is the way to log on as a stuent
# That is, this is has you log in as a new student
ssh student@127.0.0.1 -p 2200


# On your local machine run ssh-keygen to create a new public and private key pair

# Then we have to move this to the server.

# In the users home directory, make a new folder called .ssh and then inside the folder create a file called authorized keys. In that file, copy the contents of the public key on one line.

# These are some security measures that must be placed
chmod 700 .ssh
chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys

# Remember here are the following commands to see exactly what is going on:
r = 4 read
w = 2 write
x = 1 execute

# To disable password based authentication, so that users or forced to log-in via public-private key, I need to disable to password configuration, log in-system.

# To do this, run the following command to open the following file:
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Change the line that says PasswordAuthentication from "yes" to "no"
* In the case of lightsail, this was the default configuration so I didn't actually have to follow this step.






# So here is how I can log on via public-private key

Before for some reason it was working on prt 2200

ssh student@127.0.0.1 -p 2200 -i /Users/maxcarey/.ssh/linuxCourse

Afterwards, it was working on port 2222




# How does linux manage file permissions

Means its a files   ownder     group    everyone  
- 					rw- 	   r-- 	    r--

The are the file permissions

r = 4 read
w = 2 write
x = 1 execute

So 5 would be read and execute. Because of 4 + 1


## Firewalls

See status of firewall (uwf is the preinstalled firewall for ubuntu)

sudo ufw status

## It's a good idea to block all ports coming-in and then only enable the ones that you need
